# QR-Generator
A GUI Python Program To Generate QR Codes (Internet connection is necessary). You can turn a message into a QR Code by using this program. The program was easy, readable, so i did't use OOPs here. And I better know I should have done this in any other Programming Language what are far better than Python for GUIs. Reason to program GUIs in Python is just to build logical power. You can use this program, you can modify this, but you can't launch this as a softwear. Please use my name wherever you use this program. And yes!! Please give your valuable feedback.
Thank You
